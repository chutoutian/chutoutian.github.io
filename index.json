We aim to maximize the video quality while keeping rebuffering time small via encoding rate adaptation at each group of pictures (GOP) and transmission adaptation at each (transmission) slot. To capture the impact of field-of-view (FoV) prediction, we consider three cases of FoV viewing probability distributions, i.e., perfect, imperfect, and unknown FoV viewing probability distributions, and use the average total utility, worst average total utility, and worst total utility as the respective performance metrics. In the single-user scenario, we optimize the encoding rates of the tiles, encoding rates of the FoVs, and transmission beamforming vectors for all subcarriers to maximize the total utility in each case. In the multi-user scenario, we adopt rate splitting with successive decoding and optimize the encoding rates of the tiles, encoding rates of the FoVs, rates of the common and private messages, and transmission beamforming vectors for all subcarriers to maximize the total utility in each case. Then, we separate the challenging optimization problem into multiple tractable problems in each scenario. In the single-user scenario, we obtain a globally optimal solution of each problem using transformation techniques and the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. In the multi-user scenario, we obtain a KKT point of each problem using the concave-convex procedure (CCCP). Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed solutions achieve notable gains over existing schemes in all three cases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work revealing the impact of FoV prediction on the performance of adaptive streaming of tiled 360 videos.","tags":[],"title":"Adaptive Streaming of 360 Videos with Perfect, Imperfect, and Unknown FoV Viewing Probabilities in Wireless Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lingzhi Zhao"],"categories":["Daily"],"content":"Hi, it\u0026rsquo;s my first personal web, which is powered by Wowchemy.\n  ","date":1619740800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619740800,"objectID":"279b9966ca9cf3121ce924dca452bb1c","permalink":"https://chutoutian.github.io/post/getting-started.html","publishdate":"2021-04-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/getting-started.html","section":"post","summary":"Hi, it\u0026rsquo;s my first personal web, which is powered by Wowchemy.\n  ","tags":["Daily"],"title":"Hello World !","type":"post"},{"authors":["Wuyang Jiang","Chencheng Ye","Lingzhi Zhao","Ying Cui","Zhi Liu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1616976000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1616976000,"objectID":"5cdb12b9dfacdbeab3f82c5ed9bc3b88","permalink":"https://chutoutian.github.io/publication/comex2021.html","publishdate":"2021-03-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/comex2021.html","section":"publication","summary":"This letter considers optimal adaptive wireless streaming of a scalable coding-based multi-view video (MVV) to multiple users.

In the scenario without user transcoding, we jointly optimize beamforming and subcarrier, transmission power, and rate allocation to minimize the total transmission power. This problem is a challenging mixed discrete-continuous optimization problem. We obtain a globally optimal solution for small multicast groups, an asymptotically optimal solution for a large antenna array, and a suboptimal solution for the general case. In the scenario with user transcoding, we jointly optimize the quality level selection, beamforming, and subcarrier, transmission power, and rate allocation to minimize the weighted sum of the average total transmission power and the transcoding power. This problem is a two-timescale mixed discrete-continuous optimization problem, which is even more challenging than the problem for the scenario without user transcoding. We obtain a globally optimal solution for small multicast groups, an asymptotically optimal solution for a large antenna array, and a low-complexity suboptimal solution for the general case. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the significant gains of proposed solutions over the existing solutions.","tags":[],"title":"Power-Efficient Wireless Streaming of Multi-Quality Tiled 360 VR Video in MIMO-OFDMA Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lingzhi Zhao","Ying Cui","Chengjun Guo","Zhi Liu","Sheng Yang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1606780800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606780800,"objectID":"56dfb37e9c941028fca3274ef47f6719","permalink":"https://chutoutian.github.io/publication/globecom2020.html","publishdate":"2020-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/globecom2020.html","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we investigate wireless streaming of multi-quality tiled 360 virtual reality (VR) videos from a multi-antenna server to multiple single-antenna users in a multicarrier system.
